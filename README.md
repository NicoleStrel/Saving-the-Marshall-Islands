# Saving-the-Marshall-Islands

# Problem
-The marshall islands in the pacific ocean have undergone extensive nuclear testing (105 tests!)  in the 1940s as well as rising sea levels due to Global Warming (nuclear blasts contributed to this) <br />
-They are the first to fall underwater in the near future <br />
-Unfortunately irreversible, we can spread awareness to this issue and pledge donations to organizations such as https://www.atollconservation.org/ (conserves the islands) and many more. <br />
-Also, by showing the impact that global warming has on these islands, we can encourage people to enforce preventative measures. <br />

# Solution
Main Idea: provide useful visuals regarding the impact on these islands and predictions on how the rising sea levels can affect them. <br />

-Shows the 3D images of each of the inhabited islands (24 of them) and how the rising sea levels may look like in X amount of years based on statistical data online.<br />
-Shows how global warming is affecting these islands and how many years from now the people there need to start evacuating and when it becomes uninhabitable (fully underwater).<br />
-Makes predictions of how much the sea levels rise on each island in the future. This will help users understand the consequences global warming has on islands like these on a deeper level (they can visually see how they’re sinking).<br />
