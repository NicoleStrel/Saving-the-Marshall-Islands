						<h1>Realizing Children’s Rights in the Marshall Islands</h1>
						<p>The Marshall Islands suffer from a development issue, particularly in the most isolated regions. According to the Child Rights International Network (CRIN), access to drinking water and electricity can be very difficult. Moreover, in the least developed islands of the archipelago, the unstable economic situation forces families to rely upon their children’s work in order to survive. As such, universal education is compromised, leaving the deprived children of the Marshall Islands with very few prospects for the future.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Donate today to help these children grow up healthy and suceed in life.</p>

						<h1>Blindness in Marshall Islands</h1>
						<p>The Marshall Islands is an archipelago country in the Pacific Ocean. There are 24 inhabited islands, yet only two hospitals in the entire country – one in Ebeye and one in Majuro. This creates huge challenges for Marshallese living on less populated islands, who cannot easily access medical care for serious conditions. </p>

						<p>Donate today to provide sight-restoring surgeries and surgical equipment to the islands.</p>

						<h1>Provide Drought Relief to the People of the Marshall Islands</h1>
						<p>Currently a state of emergency has been called for the Northern Atolls of the Republic of Marshall Islands, in response to a long drought bringing about a critical shortage of water. This is a direct impact of climate change in the Pacific that is happening now. There are 15 northern islands experiencing real threats of increased droughts, fresh water shortages, sanitation problems, food security, and increased salinity of  fresh water lenses. It is a clear and present danger.</p>

						<p>Donate to help purchase drinking water for the local communities.</p>
